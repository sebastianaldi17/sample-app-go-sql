# Sample-App-Go-SQL
A sample app made in Go, using PostgreSQL as the database. Made this repo as a base for hosting a CRUD API in the cloud.

# To-do
- Try out writer & reader DB separation for PostgreSQL (have a different instance for read + write and read only), as well as read only replication (having more than one instance for reads)
- Add redis caching (render.com has free redis for experimenting)
