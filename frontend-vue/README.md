Vuetify frontend for sample todo app.

## ðŸ’¿ Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)     | `npm install`  |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `pnpm install` |
| [bun](https://bun.sh/#getting-started)                        | `bun install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.


## Starting the Development Server

Export the backend API address. Below is a command with the default API address:

```bash
export VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Alternatively, copy `sample.env` to `.env`, and then modify the API URL as needed.
```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

(Repeat for yarn, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

(Repeat for yarn, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
